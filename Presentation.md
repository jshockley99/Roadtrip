# Presentation: Roadtrip Playlist

* Concept - Our app creates a music playlist based on cities located within a user's road trip route. 

* Motivation for its development - Of all the ideas that we brainstormed, we thought this app would be the most usable...and the coolest. We also thought the APIs (Google Maps, Spotify) had the best documentation.

* Design process -
1. The first day was spent brainstorming ideas, doing high level research and landing on a final idea.
2. In the next stage of the project, we came up with the process flow and created our user stories.
3. On the front-end, we utilized Sketch to create a wireframe of screen flows and then divided up each screen for development.
4. On the back-end, we split the development of each API between Ovie and Peter.
5. When specific sections of code were ready, we teamed up in pairs to review the code being merged into 'Master'.
6. On the final day, we merged all functionality into the main page.

* Technologies used (and briefly how they work) - Google API, Spotify API, Bootstrap CSS and Javascript framework, Sketch for initial wireframe layout

* Demonstration of functionality 

* Directions for future development -
